# Presentation on Next Generation CSS Features

This is a presentation on next generation CSS features. To display demos correctly it will require
Chrome Canary with experimental webkit featuers enabled in chrome://flags. The Graphical featuers will
require a prototype Webkit build available from Adobe.
